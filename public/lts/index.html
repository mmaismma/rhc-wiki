Not sure how you could help? Wanted to pass on some info but didn't want to write a whole page about it? We have the answer for you!</p><p>Our aim is to improve the r/HermitCraft wiki and make it a resource we can all use to learn more, settle disputes or just nerd out for a while. This is a mammoth task and we need a lot of help achieving it. This is where you can come in.</p><h2>Join the team!</h2><p>We're looking for people to contribute in several ways. Note that YOU MUST BE OVER THE AGE OF 13 TO JOIN THE TEAM. Below are the roles we're splitting things into and what we ask each to do:</p><h3>Informer:</h3><p>What is your favorite Hermit up to now? The informer keeps up to date with a Hermit and lets the wiki team know what's new. This could be an update on their build or some major news released.</p><p>You don't need to make this all beautiful to read or find the right page for it to live. Just make sure the wiki team is aware of the facts as quickly as you can.</p><h3>Describer:</h3><p>What's that? You do want to update the Hermit's wiki pages? You love to write and like nothing more than turning facts into easily digestible information? Well that's just perfect, you should be a Describer. Take on the role of updating the details on a Hermit. You'll have the Informers helping you out with the info they provide, to support all the great knowledge you have yourself.</p><h3>Writer:</h3><p>Do you have decent wiki writing skills? Do you find developing pages and other similar tasks fun? If you answered yes to both of those questions, Writer seems like the role for you! Using your incredible writing skills you may be assigned certain one-off tasks such as developing new pages. This job may fit you if you think Describer sounds way too easy for you.</p><h3>DJ:</h3><p>Never mind those writing nerds - music is your scene! We have a job for you too. Hermit videos are filled with music and we need an expert to track down what it is. You won't have to listen to every second of every video - someone will let you know which video and the timestamp - that's when you come in and "name that tune"!</p><h3>Apply to join the team</h3><p>If this all sounds like something you want to be a part of (of course you do!) then now is the time. Check out this post.</p><p>If you have questions, ask them in the comments of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HermitCraft/comments/oz3zo0/operation_improve_the_rhermitcraft_wiki_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3">this post</a>. Any queries, bugs or suggestions related to the website itself should be sent as a non-Hermitcraft Note here.</p></div></main></div></section><svg style="display:none"><filter id="blueOverlay"><feColorMatrix type="matrix" values="1.1 0 0 0 0 0 1.1 0 0 0 0 0 1.56 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 "></feColorMatrix></filter></svg><script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/8.7.1/firebase-app.js"></script><script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/8.7.1/firebase-analytics.js"></script><script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/8.7.1/firebase-storage.js"></script><script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/8.7.1/firebase-auth.js"></script><script>let firebaseConfig = {
